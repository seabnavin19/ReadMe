## Description of the challenge
Additional information - In this competitive banking market, the bank standard fee for each type of products and services cannot be applied for all customers and therefore the Bank offers special/customized pricing to suit certain types of customers. This process involves a lot of steps which are prone to human error and is currently managed and tracked using a spreadsheet and email which is not user friendly and is difficult to maintain and search. This leads to delays and incorrect charges and ultimately it lowers customer satisfaction.
Help us deliver a unique customer experience with agility and accuracy! Build us a solution that can be used by our bank staff to quickly search customersâ€™ parameters for products, services and pricing. It needs to be easy to use, quick, scalable and most importantly accurate with updated information across all data parameters. A look up that empowers bank staff to serve our customers better
